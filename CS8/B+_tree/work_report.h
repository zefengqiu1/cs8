    Reflections:
    For this project, I deeply understand the composition of b+ tree class and how to implement this class. it is quite
    similar to the b tree.but for b+ tree, all data is stored to the last level of tree, upper level node is remark to lead to the end of tree
    B+ tree also has the fix excess and fix shortage problem. but for remove, what i did is poorman version so only manipulate
    the data at the last level of tree, inner node would leave there. It also have the pointer to the next available data so that
    it is easy to find the data based on the key.
