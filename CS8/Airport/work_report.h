 Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: bool_probability,averager,landing_machine class

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:For this project,I more deeply understand how to use the queue in the real project. When
    need to think about the requirement, we need to think about how to design the class and how many class
    we need. make sure that using the less class to fulfill the project and all the function needs. the logic
    in this project sometimes makes me confused,who goes firtst,who needs to wait, what is condition to crush.
    But once clearly understand those, it would be easy to finish and write the code.

    Finding: As long as I increse the total smulation time, the average wait time for landing plane would have
    huge change, but the average wait time and the number of plane for takeoff plane would boost a lot since the
    landing plane has the priortiy to land. Moreover, more crash plane occur since more landing request as the number
    of landing plane increased.
