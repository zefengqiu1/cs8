/*

 Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: all lower function of linkedlist and list, stack, queue class with memeber functions.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:For this project,I more deeply understand how linkedlist are worked and how data were stored in the memory.
    different data structure would be used in the future application.Also, I learn how to constructure the class with Big 3.
    double linkedlist is easier to construct stack and queue since it can track back the previous node. Write all functions'
    definition outside class.
