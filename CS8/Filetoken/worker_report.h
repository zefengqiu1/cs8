 Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: Token,stringtokenizer filetokenizer class and table functions.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
    For this project,I understand how to read the characters from the file and wrap this feature into class.
    I make sure to check the file open whether success or not and put text file into debug file so that compiler
    is able to read the file. I also remember to close the file Once done the reading. I also pay attention on the unknown
    unknown token when read from file each time. Once confront the unknown token in the file,skip to the next one.
    I also set the last index of buffer to null in order to get rid of /0 for char array.
