Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: all 15-1 15-3 15-4.


        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.


    Reflections:
    For this project,i understand that the matrix can be dynamtic based on requirement of users. using inheritance to let both
    vertex and edge have the label. vertex to store the info and label for edge can store the weight,that's why i have 2-D array
    for edge's label. check_path function use bfs algorithm as base to traverse the graph and see whether go from start to end.
