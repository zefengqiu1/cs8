Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: all avl functins are completed inclduing avl class.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.


    Reflections:
    For this project, I deeply understand the feature of avl tree that the difference of left and right subtree for each node should not
    over 2; Once it over 2,then rotate the node and adjust to avl tree. There are 4 case of situation would cover all situatin:left,right
    left_right and right_left. Every time make the change for the tree has to check rotate. There are many cases when erase the node,what
    we did just the part of all cases.Also, when do the recursion call, do not add any code below the return function since it would not
    execute.
