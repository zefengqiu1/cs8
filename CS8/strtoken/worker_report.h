 Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: Token,stringtokenizer class and table functions.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:For this project,I understand the new algorithm to get the available substring from the whole string.
    The most amazing things is that table would lead the program to find the right substirng based on the certain rule
    in the table.Obviously, table is a kind of important one to initial. Besides that, the stringtokenizerclass is not
    that hard to understand.
