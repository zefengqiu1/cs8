        -Implemented: I have completed all the requirement.

        -Partly implemented: completed all.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.


    Reflections:
    For this project, I deeply understand the composition of b tree class and how to implement this class. it is quite
    difficult and complex procedures to follow. as long as I understand hwo it changed and read the textbook, it is
    possible to convert the logic into the code but it takes time to digest.So many situations would occur when removing
    or insert the element to this class so that the tree would able to keep balance and sorted.When removing, ask for help
    to the neibours first and then merge if necessary. Map is based on the btree to complete since b tree can quick locate
    the element you are looking for.
