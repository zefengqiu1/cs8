Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: all bst functins are completed inclduing bst class.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.


    Reflections:
    For this project, I deeply understand the composition of tree structure and how item got stored inside of tree structure.
    Each root would have two children. The best way to solve the problem related to the tree is recursion function since each
    node is same. Every time do the delete, need to concern whether subtree on the left or right since tree need to be fixed.
    be sure to check whether left or right is null or not before calling any functon or private variable since it would cause
    nullpointer exception and program crashed.I also understand the composition of tree class.There is one root as private variable.
    Moveover,a bunch of api like  insert,search,erase,clear function. Remember to clear the space once the object
    get destroyed.
