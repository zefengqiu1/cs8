Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: all lower functins are completed inclduing compare,vector,info struct class,heap class,priority queue.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.


    Reflections:
    For this project, I deeply understand the composition of priority queue structure.It uses the heap to implement, info struct helps
    to wrap the things and put inside of heap so that users would not knwo anything about info.Also passing the compare object allow
    you to pick min or max priority queue as well.
