Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: all lower functins are completed inclduing vector,compare class,heap class.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.


    Reflections:
    For this project, I deeply understand the composition of heap structure. It can be imagined as tree stucture with level order
    tranvese in array, but it actually use array or dynamic array to implement since the position of tree node can be convert to the array.
    2n+1 and 2n+2 to find the left node and righ node. i represents the root and always be the largest value or smaller value after insert or pop.
    if not,use while loop to sink the one to the bottom after pop. for insert api,compare insert one with root and swap.There is another class
    bigger and smaller is quite useful in this project that it can use whether max or min heap base on my chocie and i have to make a huge change
    inside of heap class.
