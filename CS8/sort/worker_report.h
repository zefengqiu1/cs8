Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: all sorting functins are completed inclduing insertion,bubble,quick sort,merge sort heap sort.


        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.


    Reflections:
    For this project,i understand that there are a couple ways to sort the array. However,the efficient of different sort is quite
    different. The merge sort, quick sort and heap sort is more efficient than bubble and insertion sort becuase the time complexity of
    bubble and insertion sort reach the O(n^2). Quick sort is a little bit tricky among these sort functions since it needs a pivot to partition the array each time.
    so,how to pick a reasonable pivot become the important element on this sort.if the pivot is terrible or this pivot is always larggest or
    smallest, it cannot really partition the array into two part. Then,the time complexity of quick sort reach O(n^2). There is other way to avoid
    this situation is alwaws pick median value as pivot so that the array could equally be separated into two part.
