Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: I have completed open_hash,double_hash,record struct and chained_hash class

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.


    Reflections:
    For this project, I deeply understand what is hash used for. It basically used for searching things since it is efficiency and
    effective.It uses array to implement open_hash and double_hash since it could be easily found after hashing the key.We would
    have hash function to mapping the index of array. However, it would have collision when hashing the key to the same sapce
    which is been used.That's why we would have double_hash to slove the collision and spread the cluster of data since double_hash has
    second hash function to mapping the new index.But double hashing is not able to complete solve the collision. So, the best way is chained_hashing.
    Each index of array would have linkedlist. Once have the same mapping, the data would always be stored into the linkedlist as long as sapce available.
