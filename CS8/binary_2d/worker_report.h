    Reflections:
    For this project, I deeply understand how to come up the differet ways to read the file using 2d array.
    furthermore, i have complete the basic database using the vector and multiple map to select the certain
    data in the file. for my understanding,every time doing the research would create the new file and store
    the matching data into new file. Then, when doing output, read from the file and output at the same time.
