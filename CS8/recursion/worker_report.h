Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: all recursion functins are completed.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
    For this project,I understand how recursion works in computer and try to write the program using recursion.
    Basically, function call itself and have base case to stop the recursion. Based on the different situation
    and program, using the recursion way to solve the problem is quite clear with simple code. Also, when I writing
    the recursion, I tried to make sure the logic is clear since something I would get lost during the recursion.
    Therefore, I used graph to help visualize the operation if I am not very clear. In summary, recursion
    is quite useful in the future use and be sure to completely understand and familiar with it.
